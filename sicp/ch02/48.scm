;; Exercise 2.48.  A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a
;; pair of vectors -- the vector running from the origin to the start-point of
;; the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the
;; segment. Use your vector representation from exercise 2.46 to define a
;; representation for segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors
;; start-segment and end-segment.
