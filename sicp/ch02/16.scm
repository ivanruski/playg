;; Exercise 2.16. Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may
;; lead to different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that
;; does not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This
;; problem is very difficult.)

;; The short and layman answer that I can give is that interval arithmetic is
;; not the same as integer arithmetic(something I allued to in ex. 14 & 15).
;;
;; Skipping the second part.
